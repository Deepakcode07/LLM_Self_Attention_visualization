# LLM_Self_Attention_visualization

🌟 Ever wondered what makes AI like ChatGPT "pay attention" to your words? I just dove deep into the fundamentals of Transformers—the backbone of modern LLMs—and built a hands-on project in Google Colab to visualize it all. No black boxes here; let's unpack the magic of self-attention and why it's revolutionizing everything from search engines to creative writing. 🚀
At its core, Transformers (pioneered by @Google in their 2017 "Attention is All You Need" paper) ditch sequential processing for parallel computation, allowing models to weigh the importance of every word in a sentence simultaneously. Think of self-attention as the model's "focus lens": It calculates relevance scores between tokens, creating dynamic connections that capture context far beyond what old-school RNNs could dream of.
In my project, I trained a simplified Transformer on Shakespeare's works (because why not infuse some poetry into AI?). The real showstopper? Visualizing the self-attention mechanism through heatmaps. Picture this: A grid where brighter cells reveal how "To be" laser-focuses on "or not to be"—showing exactly how the model builds meaning. I also threw in t-SNE plots to cluster token embeddings in 2D space, exposing how similar characters (vowels, consonants) naturally group after training. These visuals aren't just pretty; they demystify why Transformers excel at long-range dependencies, slashing training times and boosting accuracy in real-world apps.
